                today</duration> that <name>Jon Bosak</name> pulled together the original
            <organization>XML Working Group</organization>. But yes, it was on <date when ="1998-02-10">
                February 10, 1998"</date> that <codeSpec>XML 1.0</codeSpec> was
                released to the world. Which is worth talking about.</p>
        <p>It turns out that if you follow the pointers back, the original <codeSpec>XML 1.0
            Specification</codeSpec> is still out there &amp; <rs type="person" ref="Bray_Tim">my
                fingers</rs> were the last to touch that document. The history of how XML came to be
            has been told at great length elsewhere, as have the details about <date
                when="1998-02-10">that February 10th</date>, so there’s no need to revisit.</p>
