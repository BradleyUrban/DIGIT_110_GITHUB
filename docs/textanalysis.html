            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>I descided take a look at the Corpus historic 1884. After looking at the
                        data it looks as it was based on a short dramatic text set in Spain around
                        1810, focused on a group of characters—especially Mercedes, Laboissire,
                        Louvois, Ursula, and Padre Josf—who appear to be involved in a military or
                        camp setting with French troops.</li>
                    <li>The corpus analysis shows that dialogue between these characters dominates
                        the text, with Mercedes being the most frequently mentioned. The
                        distribution graphs indicate how each character’s presence rises and falls
                        across the ten sections of the document, while the context lines show
                        snippets of their interactions. Overall, the data provides a linguistic
                        snapshot of a character-driven scene unfolding against a wartime
                        backdrop.</li>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Across both Voyant Tools and AntConc, the data reveals a narrative centered
                        heavily around characters such as Sara, Porter, and members of the Woodwards
                        family, with strong thematic emphasis on a wedding.</li>
                    <li>Voyant’s word cloud and frequency trends highlight these recurring names and
                        themes, while its summary statistics show a moderately varied vocabulary and
                        conversational readability.</li>
                    <li>AntConc’s N-gram table confirms this focus by listing the most frequent
                        two-word sequences, where combinations like “mr porter,” “a wedding,” “the
                        family,” and “by woodwards” occur multiple times. Together, the tools
                        indicate that the text is a character-driven story with repeated references
                        to family relationships, wedding preparations, and interpersonal
                        interactions, showing consistent thematic concentration throughout the
                        document.</li>
