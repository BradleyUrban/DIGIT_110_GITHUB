                <h2>Description</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alien structures have been sighted on a remote planet. Several spacecraft
                        have been sent to investigate the structures, but all communication with the
                        crew has been lost. Your mission is to search for the lost crew.</li>
                    <li>Inside the Void is an exploration game where you must navigate through seven
                        alien structures in an effort to unravel the disappearance of lost crew
                        members. You will encounter messages left by the lost crew members that
                        offer a glimpse into their fate.</li>
                    <li>Here is my sites for my analysis in <a
                            href="https://kumu.io/BradleyUrban/game-analysis#untitled-map/mate"
                            >Kumu</a> and <a

                <h2>Looks and Listen</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overall <strong>graphics</strong> of the game were exceptional and left
                        me extremely impressed. </li>
                    <li>Seeing the background of the game being the 3D shapes and archetype is the
                        core desgin of the game and its setting.</li>
                    <li>Something I noticed that I found quite fascinating is the base
                        archetype/ground actual plusing due to the gradient of design.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>sounds</strong> of the game are eriely eerie and has an
                        unsettling feeling to it.</li>
                    <li>I think overall I was dumbfounded and at awestruck with how extravagant the
                        graphics of the game. Also for how well made the story of the game come to
                        life fluently with the graphics.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="side-by-side">
                <figure class="container">
                    <input type="checkbox" name="im" id="zoom_img" />
                    <label for="zoom_img">
                        <img src="images/world.png" />

            <div>
                <h2>Interaction</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>After you land I noticed there were little sphereical podeiums around the
                        place, which I soon found out to be <strong>entry logs</strong>.</li>
                    <li>You can interact with these node that are misson logs on past
                        crewmates.</li>
                    <li>Only problem is you can only interact in this game, there is no
                        inventor.</li>
                    <li>Meaning if you want to see those past logs again you have to physically go
                        back to them which is a problem for some logs.</li>
                    <li>There is a border to the game, but it looks and feels like you could journey
                        out into the void forever.</li>
                    <li>You then see in the distance in all directions these giant 3D shapes
                        hovering over top of the world, which later you figure they are alien
                        spaceships.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Overall and Notes</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Going on to the Main person you play as, we don't have a name of this
                        person, nor do we see what they look like.</li>
                    <li>So, you only play as this mystery person, and there are also no NPC's in the
                        game too.</li>
                    <li>Menaing the only way to lnow what actually happend is to read all of logs,
                        which you should do anyway.</li>
                    <li>Going through most of the gameplay/game I can tell your suppose to visit all
                        the giant spaceships scattered around the map, and find all the entry logs
                        to see what exactly happened to the crewmates.</li>
                    <li>As a gamer and in my experience, I thought it was alright and wasn't
                        difficult to pick up on what the author was conveying.</li>
                    <li>Overall, it was a pretty cool game and defiently needs some work on it for
                        me to come back to it, but visualy enjoyoing too.</li>
