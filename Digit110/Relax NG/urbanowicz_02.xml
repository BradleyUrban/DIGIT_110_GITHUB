<p num='1'>This recipe comes from <origin>MS Codex 625</origin>, a manuscript <item>recipe book</item> 
that belonged to a student in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth century. 
The pastry school was owned by <person>Edward Kidder</person>, who taught at a few locations 
in <country>London</country> between around <date-in-time>1720 and 1734.</date-in-time> Blank books with printed title pages 
seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they learned.
Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, 
Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in <date>1720</date>.</p>

<p num='3'>Our recipe (halved from the original)

<ing><amount num='0.5'>1/2 lb.</amount> (2 sticks) butter, softened</ing>
<ing><amount num='0.5'>1/2 lb.</amount> sugar</ing>
<ing><amount num='0.25'>1/4 tsp.</amount> mace</ing>

<ing><amount num='2'>2</amount> eggs</ing>
<ing><amount num='0.75'>3/4 lb.</amount> flour</ing></p>
<steplist>    
<p num='4'>Using an <appliance>electric mixer</appliance>, cream together the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>. 
Then add the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. 
Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. 
Scoop and roll the dough by hand into <amount num='1'>1-tbsp.</amount> balls, then pat flat.
[You could also refrigerate the dough untl it’s <adj>firm</adj> enough to roll out 
on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</p>

<p num='5'>Bake at <temaputure>350F</temaputure> for <time>15-18 minutes</time> (ours were about <depth>1/3″ thick</depth>, so you could roll them thinner 
and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re done once they turn the 
slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about <amount num='24'>two dozen</amount> cookies.</p>

<title>The Results</title>

<p num='6'>If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. 
We added the <spice>cinnamon</spice> because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the <ingredient>mace</ingredient> nicely. 
These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and patted 
the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, 
but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier 
to work with a rolling pin.</p></Recipe>
